# Beatmaker Abstraction

This project really is not used for anything. It is an experimental code that has been made to study communication with the Oracle database in Java.

This project has been created using NetBeans IDE 8.1 with JDBC on Windows 7 x64. 
You need to import JDBC driver (I used ojdbc6.jar), and edit source file Database.java.

This app should look and work as on the screenshots.
